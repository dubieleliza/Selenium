**DemoQA Automation Testing Project **

A personal project aimed at showcasing my skills in web test automation using Selenium WebDriver and JUnit 5. The project covers testing links, buttons, and verifying HTTP server responses, with a strong focus on automation best practices, code readability, and efficient test synchronization. My goal was to create a comprehensive and professional repository that not only demonstrates my technical competencies but also highlights my commitment, attention to detail, and motivation for continuous skill development. This project serves as a practical example of my approach to high-quality web application testing.

**Skills Demonstrated in This Project**

Selenium WebDriver – automating web interactions (clicks, buttons, links).

JUnit 5 – structuring tests, assertions, test lifecycle management.

WebDriverWait – handling dynamic elements and synchronizing tests.

HTTP Response Validation – verifying server responses (201, 204, 400, etc.).

Cross-Window Handling – managing multiple browser windows/tabs.

Code Readability & Best Practices – clean, maintainable, and professional test code.
